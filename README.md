# Humanoid-Head
Non-verbal humanoid type communication project

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
<br>The purpose of the Humanoid Robot project is to supply aid in confined or hazardous spaces, such as those encountered in Search & Rescue, cave exploration, etc. where it may be too risky for a human to work due to various hazards such as presence of dangerous gasses. </br>
<br>The project entails programming the logic to control the head, ears, and several attached sensors of the robot, as well as designs for any components or software systems that may be necessary to achieve this.</br>
<br>The final product should be able to process decisions such as when to use a flashlight, when to alert if a gas leak is detected, and be able to engage in basic non-verbal communication with a subject.</br>
